# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms — Implemented from Scratch

Welcome to my DSA practice repository! This is where I build and explore fundamental **data structures** and **algorithms**, often implementing them from scratch in Python to deeply understand how they work under the hood.

## 💡 What’s in This Repo?

- 🔧 **Custom implementations** of core data structures (like linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, etc.)
- 🧪 **Practice problems** and applications using those data structures
- 🗂️ Organized by topic for clarity and focus
